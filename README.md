## About Me

Hi there! I'm **Simphiwe Mvumvu**, a front-end development intern at **Plum Systems** and a final-year Multimedia Applications student at CPUT. I'm passionate about turning complex problems into clean, responsive user interfaces using tools like React, Angular, JavaScript, and good old HTML/CSS.

What you're seeing here is more than just a portfolio, it's a snapshot of my journey: what I've learned, the steps I've taken to grow, and how I'm applying it all in the real world. This digital portfolio is aligned with a formal rubric that measures both technical evidence and self-reflection through the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) technique.
