##  About Me

Hi there! I'm **Simphiwe Mvumvu**, a front-end development intern at **Plum Systems** and a final-year IT student at CPUT. I’m passionate about turning complex problems into clean, responsive user interfaces using tools like React, Angular, JavaScript, and good old HTML/CSS.

What you're seeing here is more than just a portfolio, it's a snapshot of my journey: what I’ve learned, the steps I’ve taken to grow, and how I’m applying it all in the real world. This digital portfolio is aligned with a formal rubric that measures both technical evidence and self-reflection through the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) technique.

**T**: I used various self-assessment tools and project feedback to evaluate my strengths.  
**A**: I listed out my current tools—HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Angular—and added my backend exposure to Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I also asked peers and mentors where they thought I shine.  
**R**: It became clear that I thrive when designing and coding interactive UIs, especially when I can bring my ideas to life with JavaScript or React. My interest in building seamless, accessible interfaces grew stronger.

## Personality Assessment

- MBTI results and teamwork profile  
- Summary of personality strengths relevant to development roles  

** Reflection (STAR Technique)**  
**S**: I’ve always been curious about how personality influences collaboration in tech teams.  
**T**: I wanted to find out how I naturally work and communicate, especially in high-pressure or team-based environments.  
**A**: I completed multiple personality assessments and matched the results to common tech roles. I’m a logical thinker but also very empathetic, which was an interesting combo.  
**R**: I realized I’m someone who values structure but also adapts quickly. That explains why frontend fits so well—I enjoy solving layout and interaction challenges while keeping the user in mind. Plus, I now know how to present myself better in team interviews and retrospectives.
